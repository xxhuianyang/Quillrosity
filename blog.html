            <h2>Welcome to Quillrosity!</h2>
            <p>This blog commemorates Quillrosity’s journey from Quarter 1 to Quarter 4. This journey will briefly discuss how Quillrosity was made. We as a brand are very proud and thankful for the support from the dear Quillthinkers keeping curiosity alive in many different topics. If possible we’re happy to blog the beginning of this journey.</p>

              <div class="text-box">
                  <p>This quarter didn’t have any correlation when it comes to the Quillrosity brand other than our chosen content on how we'll help Sitio Bebe. But we’re mainly focused on helping and creating a proposal on how we can help a fictional location named “Sitio Bebe.” We had to create a make believe fundraiser campaign and mainly we just needed to create a website inputting our ways of sharing information and marketing our organizations fundraiser event. What I’ve learned during this quarter is having a deep understanding of how creating a website is and fully acknowledging how to make a project charity event from scratch.

                  <p>During the 2nd quarter we were tasked to create a brand. Where we will need to ideate what would be a brand that could entertain a particular target audience in Youtube. So I chose to focus on students and the younger generation. I was inspired by watching “Cunk on Earth” and “Food Theory” wherein it's not too boring and educational to learn. I thought that we should follow a format where we’re educational on some occasions and try to be entertaining in ways. So we’re technically under-educated in terms of categories in youtube.

                <div class="text-box">
                    <p>During this time, I thought, what brand name is not known or searchable in Youtube? So I had to search a lot of names until I had to search for words that symbolizes knowledge. There were many candidates but in the end I saw and chose a “Quill” when I first saw the definition. I loved the idea of the Quill being able to be a pen where you write all your ideas and curiosity within a piece of paper. In terms of visualization and meaning, I liked the idea. But I can’t just name something Quill as a brand, there are many brands that are just named Quill. So I had to search up what I could mix with Quill. Until I ended up with the word curiosity. Then boom, Quillrosity was born. After that we were tasked to create a website regarding our current brand. </p>

                  <p>When Quillrosity was under ideation process. It was really difficult to handle this since it was made by only one person from start to finish. You might ask why no teamwork? Well, it is difficult to handle groups if you’re in a group of people who can’t fully work together. So I chose to stay as an individual but during this time. I also continued to help my former group. So no grudges or bridges needed to be burned. I chose this option so I had to accept the burden of carrying all tasks and responsibilities. But during Quarter 2, it was okay yet bumpy.

                <div class="text-box">
                    <p>When Quarter 3 PBA was announced it was exciting and troubling. Mainly because we had to create our first content and we need to market them. It was very much a headache since it was a full process of its own. First we had to create a storyboard, though the outcome is that I prefer to make the script first before the storyboard since the flow of my words and action contradicts which I now note down that I should do script first before trying to figure out my storyboard. </p>

                <div class="text-box">
                  <p>During the scripting I had an issue of choosing what script I should do. Since the beginning is always the hardest part, I had so many revisions of my scripts because I was unhappy with the flow and complexity of them. So I ended up with a very simple and short introductory script. Then after that, I made my storyboard and other scripts with the lore of Quillrosity. Do note that I’m a lover of fiction and stories, embedding it within my work is truly a dream, so I mixed both worlds and made a story plot.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Next is the recording. I truly hate cameras. So knowing that I had no choice to show my face, it was truly a challenge that I had to accept. Though I did show my face a few times so it was a smooth recording. I was still unhappy by the fact that we have to post our faces on the internet. Since we were also learning Digital Privacy at the time in the Quarter so I felt uncomfortable due to many responsibilities and legal outcomes from it. </p>

                    <p>By then it was the time of editing EG, I had former knowledge on how to edit so it was a breeze but truly time consuming to do. It took a total of a whole week and a half to edit it fully. It was aggravating but I was happy with the outcome. I was proud of the work and outcome so I was excited about marketing it through facebook and other social media that I have enlisted under my brand. Then when I was finished I made my marketing plan about how I will make my work be seen more to our target audience. </p>

          <p>It's the final quarter. Our main task is to understand Youtube analysis and create our second video. During this time, the quarter started bad for me. I got sick and was unable to do my work during that time. It was annoying waking up at midnight and creating scripts while also having high fever. This led me to do my work more delayed than it should have. Since I work alone, I had to do everything. </p>
<br>
          <p>When I was making the Youtube analysis I was able to notice that many liked my video. I was very thankful and grateful to those who supported my work. Then I made my tasks for that EG like the infographic discussing the analytics of it, which was posted into the Quillrosity facebook page. Then the following task is finishing our second video.

            <p>During the time of creating the script of my second video. I chose the interesting topic of “Human cloning” since it is under active research and it seems unbelievable to be real but a possibility to come to real life. So I started researching and creating my draft of my work. Though when I was recording and editing the video, I was truly disappointed that I wasn’t able to push my work more. Though sadly I had to accept a work that meets the rubrics but was subpar onto my taste and ideas. This was the reason for our short time to pass through the deadline and I was dealing with sickness.
            </p><br><p>When I edited the video, I was just happy that it was finished and was able to get an “okay” feedback. Though then again, I wasn’t happy with the final video since there were more things I could have done to improve it.

          <p>The following is to post it and market it through social media. Our final task is to create a website talking about our journey and embedding our youtube videos into a website. Which is the purpose of this blog itself. But it is also another way to show the Quillthinkers who are interested in knowing the origin of this brand. I’m thankful for all the support given throughout the creation process of Quillrosity productions. But I’m ending this off with a thank you for the Quillrosity family who keeps thinking and curious about anything.

          <h3> Final Remarks</h3>
          <p>Hello! This is Precious putting my final remarks for this blog. I’m again thankful for all the support that was given to me throughout the quarters. It was tough to do everything individually but I’ve learned many things throughout the way. It made me learn the importance of branding and marketing which I wish I will never touch or learn in the future. But it was a fun thing to do since I gained so many ideas and innovation in creating websites and videos.  I have learned the importance within Q1 to Q4 how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

            <p>This school year was truly something. But I’m grateful that I held on and continued to follow my responsibilities. I do wish that I could have done more in my past projects. Especially my Q4 video since there were a lot of errors and issues that I can list down. But overall, I’m happy with what I got and experienced. Quillrosity may only be a project in high school that I might forget, but I’m grateful for the things I’ve learned and picked up in making Quillrosity from scratch. This is probably the end of the brand but if there is a possibility of continuation, I might create more videos in the future and build a social media presence. I’m again thankful for your support but I’ll now be signing off~</p>
